# BuzzWireGame

A challenging game which involves guiding a metal loop along a serpentine length of wire without touching the loop to the wire. The loop and wire are connected to a power source in such a way that, if they touch, they form a closed electric circuit. The circuit is connected to a sound-emitting device, so that when the loop and the wire touch, the sound-emitting device will make a buzzing noise.
